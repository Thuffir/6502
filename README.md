# A Simple 6502 / 65C02 implementation for [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital)
![Circuit](6502.svg)

This implementation aims simplicity for educational purposes.

It is fully 6502 and 65C02 compatible and passes all functional and extended opcode tests from [Klaus Dormann's test suite](https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests), but it is **NOT** cycle accurate with the original cpu versions.
(The actual cycles for each opcode can be seen in the [microcode ROM files](ucode/ucode_6502.hex)).

The microcode is generated by a [C program](ucode/ucode.c) and can generate the 6502 or 65C02 microcode. (Use any C compiler, but it has been only tested with GCC.)

The interrupts are handled by injecting the **BRK** opcode just in the original CPU.

To start open the [6502.dig](6502.dig) file in [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital).
The test suite will be loaded into the RAM and the simulation can be started.
(The test suite runs quite a long time but when it finishes it loads ASCII `'E'($45)`, `'N'($4E)`, `'D'($44)` into the registers `A` `X` and `Y` and the `PC` loops around `$34DE`.)

There is also a generic version of the [CPU](cpu.dig) with isolated data bus which can be included as a sub-circuit and configured as either 6502 or 65C02. For examples see [6502test.dig](6502test.dig) and [65c02test.dig](65c02test.dig).
In this versions the test suit outputs to the memory mapped data terminal at address `$0000`.

Unfortunately Digital does not allow to "dive" into a sub-circuit during the simulation, but if you right click on the RAM you can view it's contents updating during the simulation.

You will need:
- [Helmut Neemann's Digital simulator](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital) to run the circuit
- A C compiler if you want to change the microcode easily
- A 6502 assembler if you want to run your own 6502 code
